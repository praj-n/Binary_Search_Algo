# Binary_Search_Algo
The binary search algorithm is a very important one, and requires you to create a list of numbers between 0 and an upper limit, with every succeeding number having a difference of 2 between them. 
When the user inputs a random number to be searched the program begins its search by dividing the list into two halves. First, the first half is searched for the required number and if found, the other half is rejected and vice versa. The search continues until the number is found or the subarray size becomes zero.
